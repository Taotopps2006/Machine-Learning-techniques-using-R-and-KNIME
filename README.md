Analysis of the Adult dataset using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

# Introduction
In the present day, data is created constantly from several sources for example through sensor devices and social media, and growing at an unprecedented rate in different forms (volume, velocity, variety) due to technology, and challenges are being faced on how to handle, analyse and make sense from these huge data in order to turn them into useful information and knowledge.

Extracting knowledge from these huge datasets follows a seven-step process called Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD). Data Mining is an integral part where intelligent techniques are applied in order to extract patterns (Han and Kamber 2006). In this report, we have chosen to explore the Adult dataset / US census dataset using two data mining techniques namely classification algorithm and association rule mining. In addition, two software tools were used for data analysis; **R and KNIME.

The remainder of this report is structured as follows: In Section 2, we present a description of the chosen dataset. In Section 3, we performed exploratory data analysis and, in Section 4 and 5, data mining techniques were applied on the pre-
